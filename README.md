# GrillHub--UI-UX-

UI/UX design process of GrillHub using Figma.

Project Background:-
GrillHub, an imaginary restaurant located in Sunwal providing all sorts of BBQ services to the customers of this area since 2020. 
Focusing on the goals of “Quality, Healthy and Tradition” the restaurant is family operation making each dish in their own kitchens from scratch. Through hard work and dedication, GrillHub began building its brand around the idea of delicious and authentic BBQ food.
They honor their customers by providing them with the freshest, most delicious and authentic meal experience possible with tranquil environment.

Objective of designing this project:-
The main objective of designing this project was to test my abilities on figma and gather as much feedback as possible for future improvements.

Prototypes are created using different component variants. Prototypes are then created on pages after component prototyping.

This project is designed in desktop version only and I’ll soon be designing this project for mobile version. 

Feedbacks are always appreciated.
